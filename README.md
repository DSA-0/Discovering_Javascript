# Discovering_Javascript
3 basic projects: 1st is Sorting with JavaScript and DOM, Dynamic Recipe Page and the last is a Data Transmission with VUE JS.

Sorting with Java Script and DOM

This is an example of a simple web page where you can enter a numerical value that will be added to an unnumbered list below. After inserting some values, we can order them according to the chosen algorithm, where we have the bubble as the default option, as well as the insertion and quick methods. Another possibility is to mix up the sequence and, finally, we can clear everything to start over with a new list of values to be inserted.

Dynamic Recipe Page with JSON elements

Now that we have the page design for the 'Meu Feij√£o' recipe site, let's bring the cards to life using Javascript. With this language, we can access and manipulate data that is stored in JSON files. Thus, we can dynamically generate the content and html structure of the cards, without having to repeat code.

Data Transmission with VUE JS.
Finally, we created an application that uses, with the help of the Vue.JS library, JSON data hosted on the web to present a catalog of users, with photo, name and email.
